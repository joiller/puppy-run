# PuppyRun

PuppyRun is an agentic, evidence-grounded workbench for technical stack and architecture decisions.

The first demo workflow focuses on AI Agent technology stack selection. The first client is a web console, while the core decision workflow is designed to be reusable by future clients such as desktop, mobile, CLI, or IDE integrations.

The project is currently in Phase 0: deployable skeleton.
